## **My process**

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS custom Styles
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned the concept of Mobile-first design/development
- Was able to reinforced my knowledge of CSS Media queries, for implementing responsive features/layouts for mobile devices.

**Below is an excerpt of the CSS media query code/syntax I used in implementing the responsive features of this project:**

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 375px) {
}
```

### Continued development

## Plans for continued development

I hope to in the future, focus and refine my skills in the front-end development field and also master the concepts of responsive designs, concepts of of semantics in HTML as well as accessibility and other key concepts/knowledge required in becoming a world class in front-end development.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Media queries Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand **CSS Media queries**. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
